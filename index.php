				<article>

					<p>We are Kentucky's Local Boxing Committee.  We are a  subset of USA
					Boxing, the umbrella for all amateur boxing in the United States.  Our
					main goal is to promote amateur boxing while striving to provide a safe,
					competitive environment for youth.  This website lists all current registered
					coaches, athletes, gyms and officials as well as events and results.
					Kentucky is home to numerous amateur national champions as well as four
					heavyweight proffesional boxing champions; Marvin Hart, Jimmy Ellis, Greg Page
					and Muhammad Ali.  With your support we can usher in the new generation of
					champions!</p>
